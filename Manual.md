## SETUP (Page 4)

A. Place the game board in your play area (with the side shown face up), and then place the following components on it:

A1. Place the Shield Wall token in the marked area below the Spice Reﬁnery board space.
 
A2. Place the four Alliance tokens on the marked areas of the Faction's Inﬂuence tracks (Emperor, Spacing Guild, Bene Gesserit, and Fremen).

B. Create A Conﬂict Deck:

Separate the Conﬂict cards by their backs: Conﬂict I, Conﬂict II, and Conﬂict III.

Shuffle the four Conﬂict III cards and place **all** of them face down in the marked area of the game board.

Shuffle the nine Conﬂict II cards, then deal **ﬁve** face down on top of the Conﬂict III cards.

Shuffle the three Conﬂict I cards, then deal **one** face down on top of the Conﬂict II cards.

You should now have a 10-card Conﬂict Deck on the game board, with one Conﬂict I card on top, ﬁve Conﬂict II cards below it, then the four Conﬂict III cards on the bottom. Return the unused Conﬂict cards to the game box without looking at them.

C. Prepare the following cards along the edge of the game board. (If you're not using the CHOAM module described on page 16, omit any cards marked with a black circle bordered with an orange-colored ring.)
  
C1. Shuffle the Intrigue Deck and place it face down.
  
C2. Shuffle the Imperium Deck and place it face down. From it, deal ﬁve cards face up to form an Imperium Row.

C3. Next to the Imperium Row, place the Reserve cards in two stacks: one for Prepare the Way and one for The Spice Must Flow.
  
D. Each player takes a Leader and places it in front of them. (You may choose or select at random.) Do not use Shaddam Corrino IV unless you are using the CHOAM module.

Leaders have from one to three icons after their names. Leaders with more icons are more strategically complex. **For your ﬁrst game, it is recommended** that each player chooses a Leader with just one icon.

(PAGE 5)
E. Each Player Takes A 10-Card starting deck, shuffles it, and places it face down in their supply to the left of their Leader.
Games for one, two, or six players require additional setup. For details, see the separate rules supplements: Rivals or Six-Player Games.

F1. **Each player takes 1 water** and places it in their supply.

F2. Create a bank next to the game board containing the Solari, spice, remaining
water tokens, and the sandworms you prefer (either wood, plastic, or both). These are not meant to be limited; if you run out and need more, make any convenient substitution. also, add the 4 Maker Hooks tokens to the bank.

G. Each player chooses a color and takes all of its components.

G1. Place two of your Agents on your Leader. Place your third Agent (your Swordmaster) Next To The Game Board.

G2. Place one of your two discs on the Score track. In a 4-player game, place it on the 1 space. Otherwise, place it on the 0 space.

G3. Place your Combat marker (with the side shown at the right face up) on the 0 space of the Combat track.

G4. Place four cubes, one each, on the bottom spaces of the Inﬂuence tracks of the four Factions.

G5. The other 12 cubes represent your troops. Place three in one of the four circular garrisons on the game board (each player taking the one closest to them).

G6. Place your remaining components in your supply, in clear view of all players.

H. Shuffle the Objective cards. (Some are marked "1-3P" or "4/6P," for those numbers of players. Omit any that don't match your player count, returning them to the game box.)

Each player draws one Objective at random, then places it face up in their supply. The player whose objective shows the First Player marker takes that marker.

In step A, there is no Mentat; place the Shield Wall token on the board instead. In step C3, there are no Foldspace cards. Sandworms and Maker Hooks are placed in the bank in step F2. Spies are added to the components each player takes in step G. Objective cards are distributed in step H, and these determine the first player.

## GAME OVERVIEW AND MAJOR CONCEPTS (Page 6)

### OBJECTIVE (Page 6)

You are a Leader representing one of the Great Houses of the Landsraad (or another powerful ﬁgure on the galactic stage). Defeat your rivals in Combat, wield political Inﬂuence, and form alliances with the four major Factions. Your successes will be measured in **Victory Points**.

Whenever you gain or lose a Victory Point, move your Score marker up or down one space on the Score track. At the end of a round, if any player has reached 10 or more Victory Points (or if the Conﬂict Deck is empty), the game ends, and whoever has the most Victory Points wins.

### LEADERS (Page 6)

Each Leader has two different unique abilities:

The ﬁrst, is used during play as described on the Leader.
This one is the Leader itself.

The second, the card which is marked by the Signet Ring icon, is activated when you play your Signet Ring card on one of your Agent turns.

### DECK-BUILDING (Page 6)

You start the game with a 10-card deck containing the same cards as the other players. Adding to and changing that deck is the key element of play in a deck-building game. During each round, you may acquire new cards to add to your deck. Because cards do many different things, each player's deck and strategy will diverge from the others as the game unfolds.

Whenever you acquire a new Imperium or Reserve card, it is ﬁrst placed **in your discard pile**. Any time you're unable to draw a card because your deck is empty, you reshuffle your discard pile to form a new deck, then continue to draw as needed.

There are also ways to **"trash"** cards, removing them from your deck altogether for the rest of the game. By strategically removing weaker cards from your deck, you increase the chances of drawing your stronger cards more often.
Cards of any type can override usual rules of the game!

### AGENTS (Page 6)

You start the game with two Agents (and can gain a third during play). You send Agents to spaces on the game board, sometimes gathering resources, sometimes paying resources to advance your strategy. (This is explained fully in Phase 2: Player Turns, while board spaces are described in detail in the separate Board Space Guide sheet.)

In DUNE: ***IMPERIUM — UPRISING***, Agents and cards are tightly linked; you can't send an Agent to a board space without ﬁrst playing a card that allows it.
There Is No Mentat Agent In UPRISING.

### FACTIONS (Page 7)

In DUNE: IMPERIUM — UPRISING, the four Factions represent powerful forces on Dune and elsewhere in the Imperium. Increasing your **Inﬂuence** and earning an Alliance with one or more of them is one of the key routes to victory in the game. See "Across the Imperium" on Page 2 for short descriptions of each of the Factions.

Your Faction cubes begin at the bottom of each Faction's Inﬂuence track. Throughout the game, your Inﬂuence with a Faction will increase or decrease, depending on the cards you play and the actions you take. When you send an Agent to a Faction's board space, gain one Inﬂuence with that Faction by advancing your cube one space on its Inﬂuence track. Other game effects can also move your cube up (and occasionally down) the track.

When you reach 2 Inﬂuence with a Faction, you gain a Victory Point. If you drop back below 2 Inﬂuence, you lose that Victory Point.

When you reach 4 Inﬂuence, you earn the bonus shown on that space of the track. If you drop back below 4 Inﬂuence, you do not give back the bonus. (It's possible—though unusual—to earn the same bonus more than once, if you move back then advance again.)

The **ﬁrst** player to reach 4 Inﬂuence with a Faction also earns an **Alliance** with that Faction. They take the Alliance token from the track, put it in their supply, and gain the Victory Point shown on the Alliance token. If they are ever passed by an opponent rising to a **higher** space on the track, they must give the Alliance token to that opponent; they lose that Victory Point and the opponent gains it.

### INTRIGUE CARDS (Page 7)

Intrigue cards represent subterfuge, backroom dealings, and surprise twists — they can provide resources like water or spice, increase your Inﬂuence with a Faction, or even score Victory Points. Each Intrigue card indicates when it can be played, what effect it has, and whether there are costs or conditions to playing it.

You receive Intrigue cards primarily from board spaces such as Secrets, Sardaukar, and Assembly Hall. (But look for other opportunities on cards, wherever you see the Intrigue card icon.) They are kept face down, separate from your deck. You may look at them at any time. Reveal them to your opponents only when you play them. Once an Intrigue card is played and resolved, place it face up in a discard pile next to the Intrigue Deck.

There are **three types** of Intrigue cards: Plot, Combat, and Endgame.

- You may play a Plot Intrigue card any time during one of your Agent or Reveal turns.

- You may play a Combat Intrigue card only during Combat.

- You may play an Endgame Intrigue card only at the end of the game.

## ROUND STRUCTURE (Page 8)

DUNE: IMPERIUM — UPRISING is played in a series of rounds. Each round consists of ﬁve phases, in this order:

1. Round Start

2. Player Turns
   
   Agent Turn
   
   Reveal Turn

3. Combat

4. Makers

5. Recall

### PHASE 1: ROUND START (Page 8)

Each round begins by revealing a new Conﬂict card from the top of the Conﬂict Deck. Place it face up in the space next to the Conﬂict Deck (on top of any Conﬂict cards that might remain from previous rounds).

Next, each player draws ﬁve cards from **their own** deck, forming their hand for the round.

### PHASE 2: PLAYER TURNS (Page 8)

Starting with the player who has the First Player marker and continuing clockwise, players take one turn at a time.

On your turn, you will take either an **Agent turn** or a **Reveal turn**. These types of turns are detailed over the next ﬁve pages. Generally, you will take Agent turns until you run out of Agents to place, then you will take a Reveal turn. (Note that Agent turns are optional. If you choose to, you can take a Reveal turn while you still have Agents instead of taking an Agent turn.)

Once you've taken a Reveal turn, your turns are skipped for the rest of the phase, while other players ﬁnish taking their turns. Once all players have taken a Reveal turn, this phase ends.

You may play any **Plot Intrigue cards** you have during this phase, at any point during one of your own Agent or Reveal turns.

#### CARD ANATOMY (Page 8)

The effects of each card in your deck are divided into two parts: an Agent box and a Reveal box. On any given turn, you may use the effects contained in only one of those boxes: the Agent box during an Agent turn, or the Reveal box during a Reveal turn.

A. Name
  Top left on the screen.

B. Faction
  ***Not all cards are part of a Faction.***
  Located under the name.

C. Agent Icons
  Middle left on the card

D. Agent Box
  Middle bottom on the card, with the grey background.

E. Reveal Box
  Bottom of the card and under the Agent box, with the dark blue background.

F. Persuasion Cost
  Top right on the screen, a specific number with a blue diamond shape.

G. Acquire effect
  ***Not all cards have an Acquire effect
  Located under the persuasion cost***.

### PLAYER TURN – AGENT TURN (Page 9)

In an Agent turn, you play one card from your hand face up in front of you, using it to send an Agent from your Leader to an unoccupied space on the game board. This board space must have an icon in its upper left corner matching one of the Agent icons on the card. (Though Spies, explained on page 11, provide an alternative to this.)

You must choose only **one** Agent icon on your card; one card can't send multiple Agents.

**You can't send an Agent to a board space that already has one.** (Though Spies, explained on page 11, can provide a way around this.)

You must pay any costs and meet any requirements of the board space you choose.

In addition, the Agent box of the card you played may provide an effect when you play it on an Agent turn. (You ignore the Reveal box of the card during Agent turns.)

If a card does not have any Agent icons on it, you may not play it during an Agent turn. It may only be revealed during a Reveal turn.

#### Board Space Costs (Page 9)

To send an Agent to some board spaces, you must pay a cost. If you can't pay the cost **immediately** (before resolving any effects of the space or the card you played), you can't send your Agent there.

Here are the two Fremen spaces on the game board. The top space, "Desert Tactics," requires that you pay 1 water to send an Agent there.

The bottom space, "Fremkit," has no additional cost.

#### Inﬂuence Requirements (Page 9)

To send an Agent to certain board spaces, you must have enough Inﬂuence with a particular Faction.

**Imperial Privilege** requires 2 or more Inﬂuence with the Emperor.

**Shipping requires** 2 or more Inﬂuence with the Spacing Guild.

**Sietch Tabr requires** 2 or more Inﬂuence with the Fremen.

The eight different Agent icons are:

Emperor
  > White letter T with a semicircle on top of it.

Spacing Guild
  > Red infinity symbol.

Bene Gesserit
  > Purple bug-like shape.

Fremen
  > Blue sphere that contains a blue core inside.

Landsraad
  > Green pentagon shape.

City
  > Blue circle

Spice Trade
  > Yellow triangle

Spy
 > Symbol of a grey eye

This ***Imperial Spymaster*** card has two Agent icons. The Emperor icon allows you to send your Agent to either of the two Emperor board spaces, while the Spy icon allows you to send it to any board space connected to an observation post where you have a Spy.

When you play a card and send an Agent to a board space, you gain the effects of the board space as well as the effects contained in the Agent box of the card. If the board space belongs to one of the Factions, you also move your cube one space up on its Inﬂuence track. **You may carry out all these effects in any order.**

Some card effects are written out, but many are iconized. Refer to the separate Board Space Guide sheet for an explanation of all board spaces, and the back cover of the rulebook for a guide to all game icons and additional game terms.

Arrows on cards and on the board (white arrow pointing to the right) indicate that there is a cost (left of the arrow, or above it) you must pay to get the effect (right of the arrow, or below it). You are never forced to pay such a cost. However, if you don't, you won't gain the effect. You may only pay the cost and gain the effect once during your turn.

When you play Ecological Testing Station, you may decide not to pay 2 water to draw two cards. (You may not pay 4 water to draw four cards.)

There are additional board spaces requiring 2 Inﬂuence with a Faction, and a new Agent icon (Spy).

### PLAYER TURN – AGENT TURN (CONTINUED Page 10)

#### Units And Conﬂict (Page 10)

At the start of each round, the current Conﬂict card is revealed, offering rewards for which the players will compete in Combat. Players will need to deploy units to ﬁght for these rewards. There are two types of units: troops and sandworms.

The ***RISE OF IX*** expansion includes another type of unit, called dreadnoughts.

Whenever the cube icon appears on a card or board space, you recruit one troop. Take a troop from your **supply** and place it in your **garrison** on the game board.
(If you run out of troops in your supply, you can't recruit more until some return there.)

Units won't help you win combats while in your garrison, however. You may deploy them to a Conﬂict when you send an Agent to a Combat space. Combat spaces are board spaces that feature a desert illustration and crossed swords. While most of these appear on the planet Dune itself, three appear with the Factions: one with the Spacing Guild (Heighliner) and two with the Fremen (Desert Tactics and Fremkit).

When you send an Agent to a Combat space, you may deploy units to the Conﬂict area—the area of the game board in the center of the garrisons. You may deploy **any or all** units recruited during your current turn (including from the board space and from the card you played), plus **up to two** more units from your garrison. (The Conﬂict area is divided into quadrants. Keep your deployed units in the quadrant nearest to your garrison.)

Whenever the sandworm icon appears on a card or board space, you summon and immediately deploy a sandworm to the Conﬂict. (A sandworm can never be placed in a garrison.) Two restrictions also limit the summoning of sandworms:

First, the sandworm icon is usually prefaced by a requirement to have a
Maker Hooks token on your garrison (which can be obtained at Sietch Tabr).

Second, a sandworm can't be summoned to a Conﬂict protected
by the Shield Wall. (See Critical Locations and the Shield Wall.)

#### Critical Locations And The Shield Wall (Page 10)

Some Conﬂict cards (explained more in Phase 3: Combat) represent a struggle taking place at one of three locations on Dune: Arrakeen, Spice Reﬁnery, or Imperial Basin (based on the card's title). If you win such a Conﬂict, your rewards include control of the board space: take a **Control marker** from your supply and place it on the ﬂag below the appropriate space.

While your Control marker is on one of these spaces, you receive the bonus shown whenever any player (yourself included) sends an Agent there. The bonus is 1 Solari for Arrakeen or Spice Reﬁnery, and 1 spice for Imperial Basin.

When a Conﬂict card is revealed for a space that you already control, you receive a defensive bonus: you may deploy one troop from your supply to the Conﬂict.

These three important locations are protected from storms and sandworms by a Shield Wall, a token placed on the board during setup. While this token remains in place, no sandworms can be summoned to a Conﬂict at one of these three protected locations. However, it is possible for a player to blast a hole in the Shield Wall.

When the Shield Wall detonation icon appears on a card or board space, you may remove the Shield Wall token from its place on the board
(returning it to the box). Once this token has been removed, sandworms may be summoned to any Conﬂict.

Sandworms are a new type of unit, detailed in the ﬁnal three paragraphs at the left. The Shield Wall protects against their use, as detailed in the ﬁnal two paragraphs above.

#### Spies (Page 11)

Across the board are various **observation posts** where players may place Spies. Each of these is connected to one or more board spaces.

Whenever the Spy icon appears on a card or board space, you may place a Spy from your supply on an unoccupied observation post on the board. If you have no Spies in your supply when you need to place one, you may ﬁrst recall one of your Spies for no effect.

Some effects allowing you to place a Spy (like the one from the Lady Margot Fenring Leader, pictured at the right) specify a particular Agent icon that must be connected to the observation post, or you can't place the Spy.

When the Recall Spy icon appears on a card, you may return one of your Spies from an observation post to your supply. (This will usually be a cost to get a powerful effect.)

A Spy may also be recalled (without the use of a card), for one of two effects:

- **Inﬁltrate**: If you wish to send an Agent to a board space occupied by another player, you may recall your own Spy from a connected observation post to ignore the other player's Agent and send your Agent to that same board space.

- **Gather Intelligence**: Whenever you send an Agent to a board space, you may recall your own Spy from a connected observation post to draw a card. You must choose whether to do this immediately after placing your Agent (before receiving any effects of the board space or card you played).

You cannot recall the same Spy to both Inﬁltrate and Gather Intelligence. (Though on certain spaces, like the Research Station, you may be able to recall one Spy to Inﬁltrate and another Spy to Gather Intelligence.)

The Spy Agent icon allows you to send an Agent to a board space connected to an observation post where you currently have a Spy. You do not recall the Spy for this purpose.

***John plays Dune, the Desert Planet to send an Agent to Imperial Basin. He collects spice from the space. His card provides no additional Agent turn effect.***

***Imperial Basin is a Combat space. John didn't recruit any troops with either the card he played or the board space where he sent his Agent. But he does have three troops in his garrison. He decides to fight as hard as he can, and deploys two troops from his garrison to the Conflict—the maximum number allowed.***

***Abby plays Rebel Supplier to send an Agent to Arrakeen. She has a Spy there and decides to recall it to Gather Intelligence, drawing a card. John's Control marker is there from an earlier round, so he takes 1 Solari from the bank.***

***From the board space, Abby recruits a troop and draws another card. With Rebel Supplier, she recruits two additional troops because she recalled a Spy this turn.***

***Abby could keep her three newly recruited troops in her garrison. But Arrakeen is also a Combat space, and she senses a chance for victory over John. She deploys those troops to the Conflict, plus one more that she already had in her garrison. (If she'd had a second troop there, she could have deployed it as well.)***

***Ned decides to use his turn to build up troops to fight on a later round. He plays Dagger to send an Agent to Gather Support. He decides to pay the space's optional cost of 2 Solari, so he gains one water and two troops. It isn't a Combat space, however, so he can't deploy any troops to the Conflict, and places them in his garrison instead.***

Spies are a new element of the game, detailed above.

### PLAYER TURN – REVEAL TURN (Page 12)

When a player has no more Agents for Agent turns (or **chooses** not to use any Agents they have remaining), that player takes a Reveal turn. This consists of the following steps in order: Reveal Cards, Resolve Reveal Effects, and Clean Up.

#### REVEAL CARDS (Page 12)

Reveal all cards remaining in your hand, placing them face up in play in front of you. Keep them separate from other cards you played previously on Agent turns.

#### RESOLVE REVEAL EFFECTS (Page 12)

You now gain the effects in the Reveal boxes of all the cards you just revealed (but not those of any cards you played during Agent turns earlier in the round).

You may resolve Reveal effects in any order you like. In addition, you may use Persuasion that you've gained to acquire new cards for your deck before, between, or after your Reveal effects.

##### Setting Your Strength (Page 12)

After you Reveal Cards, but before you Clean Up, you also total your strength for the Combat this round.

Each unit you have **in the Conﬂict** adds to your strength. (Units in your garrison or supply contribute nothing.) Each troop is worth 2 strength. Each sandworm is worth 3 strength.

Each sword you revealed during your Reveal turn is worth 1 strength.

**You must have at least one unit in the Conﬂict to have any strength.** If your last unit is ever removed, your strength becomes 0.

When you've totaled your strength, announce it to your opponents and move your Combat marker to the corresponding space on the Combat track. If your strength is over 20, ﬂip the marker to the +20 side and start again from the beginning of the track.

#### CLEAN UP (Page 12)

Remove all the cards from in front of you (from your Agent and Reveal turns) and put them in your discard pile.

##### Acquiring Cards (Page 13)

The Persuasion you gain during a round is used during your Reveal turn to
acquire new cards for your deck. You may acquire any of the ﬁve cards in the Imperium Row, or ***Prepare the Way or The Spice Must Flow*** from the Reserve.

The cost to acquire a card is shown at the top right of that card. You may acquire as many cards as you like, as long as you have enough Persuasion to spend. You may pool Persuasion from multiple sources (cards and board spaces) to acquire one card, and may split Persuasion from a single source to pay for different cards. Persuasion is not represented by any tokens because you can never save it; any Persuasion you don't use during your Reveal turn is lost.

When you acquire a card, place it in your discard pile (face up to the right of your Leader). You don't get to use the new card right away; you will shuffle it along with the rest of your discard pile when you run out of cards to draw.

The Imperium Row must always have ﬁve cards; whenever it does not, replace missing cards from the top of the Imperium Deck. This means that after you acquire one card, you may then acquire the card that replaces it (if you have enough Persuasion). 

***John takes a Reveal turn, revealing the three cards remaining in his hand: Prepare the Way, Rebel Supplier, and Strike Fleet.***

***Rebel Supplier has an effect to resolve. John takes 1 spice from the bank. His cards also provide Persuasion and swords.***

***John's cards give a total of 3 Persuasion. He uses 2 of it to acquire Desert Survival from the Imperium Row, placing it in his discard pile. A new card is then dealt from the Imperium Deck to fill the empty space in the Row. Although John has 1 Persuasion left, there are no cards available that cost only 1.***

***John has two troops in the Conflict, providing a total of 4 strength. The cards he revealed this turn provide 4 more: 1 sword from Rebel Supplier and 3 swords from Strike Fleet. He sets his Combat marker at 8 on the Combat track.***

***John decides to play an Intrigue card, Unexpected Allies. John pays 2 water, removes the Shield Wall token from the board, and summons a sandworm, which he takes from the bank and places directly into the Conflict. With the sandworm added to his forces, John adjusts his Combat marker from 8 to 11, then discards the Intrigue card.***

***Finally, John takes the remaining cards in front of him and puts them in his discard pile.***

***The phase continues. Abby and Ned will take a Reveal turn at some point. John is done until the Combat phase.***

Setting Your Strength is no longer an explicit step between "Resolve Reveal Effects" and "Clean Up." Set strength at any point while resolving reveal effects, and update it as needed. This distinction allows cards like the new Gurney Halleck Leader to reference your strength during your Reveal turn.

### PHASE 3 : COMBAT (Page 14)

Combat is resolved during this phase, but ﬁrst, players have the chance to play Combat Intrigue cards.

#### COMBAT INTRIGUE CARDS (Page 14)

Starting with the player who has the First Player marker and continuing clockwise, each player with at least one unit in the Conﬂict may play any number of Combat Intrigue cards, or may pass.

You are not required to pass just because you passed earlier in the Combat phase. Once all players involved in Combat pass **consecutively**, you then resolve the Combat.

If a card changes the number of units a player has in the Conﬂict (or otherwise alters their strength), they adjust their Combat marker accordingly on the Combat track. (Remember: if you have no units in the Conﬂict, your strength is 0.)

#### RESOLVE COMBAT (Page 14)

Rewards from the Conﬂict card are given to players based on their strength, as shown on the Combat track. 

The player with the highest strength wins the Conﬂict and gains the ﬁrst reward on the Conﬂict card. The player with the second highest strength gains the second reward. In a game with four (or six) players, the player with the third highest strength gains the third reward. (With three or fewer players, the third reward is used only in a tie for second place, as described in the **Ties** section.) Finally, the winner takes the Conﬂict card, places it in their supply face up, then checks for a battle icon match (see Battle Icons below).

A player with 0 strength does not receive any reward.

Refer to this rulebook's back cover for a guide to the icons used on Conﬂict cards.

Once all rewards have been given, each player takes their troops from the Conﬂict and puts them in their supply (**not their garrison**). Reset all Combat markers to 0 on the Combat track. Return any sandworms from the Conﬂict to the bank.

##### Battle Icons (Page 14)

There are three battle icons: Crysknife, Desert Mouse, and Ornithopter. When you win a Conﬂict and take that card into your supply, check if you have another face-up Conﬂict or Objective card in your supply with the same battle icon. If you do, you must ﬂip the matching pair of cards face down and gain 1 Victory Point.

> Battle icons are cards with symbols of knife, Mouse, and Ornithopter.

##### Ties (Page 14)

When any number of players tie for ﬁrst place:

- They each gain the second reward. No one wins the Conﬂict or takes the Conflict card into their supply.

- If there are three or fewer players, no other rewards are given for the Conﬂict. In a game with four (or six) players, if three or more of them tied for ﬁrst place, no other rewards are given; however, if exactly two players tied for ﬁrst place, the remaining players compete to gain the third reward.

When any number of players tie for second place, they each gain the third reward. The winner of the Conﬂict keeps their rewards (and takes the Conﬂict card into their supply), but no further rewards are given.

When any number of players tie for third place, they receive nothing.

##### Sandworm Reward Doubling (Page 14)

When taking rewards, if you have one or more sandworms in the Conﬂict, **double the rewards** you take. Most rewards can be doubled (but taking control of a location cannot, nor can battle icons on Conﬂict cards you win). When a reward offers the option to pay a cost to gain something, you may pay the cost a second time to gain it a second time.

***If you win this reward with one or more sandworms, you gain 2 Influence (with the same Faction or two different Factions), and may also pay 3 spice to gain a Victory Point, or 6 spice to gain 2.***

Battle Icons and Sandworm Reward Doubling bring new strategic considerations to Combat. After other rewards are taken, the winner of a Conﬂict takes the Conﬂict card into their supply and checks for a battle icon match. Sandworms are returned to the bank after combat.

***As the Combat Phase begins, John has 11 strength and Abby has 9 strength. John has the First Player marker, but he's already ahead in the Conflict. He passes on the chance to play a Combat Intrigue card.***

***Abby is next, and does play an Intrigue card, Contingency Plan. It gives her 3 more strength, and she advances her Combat marker to 12.***

***Ned is next in player order, but has no troops in the Conflict. He has 0 strength and can't take part in this phase.***

***It's now back to John. Even though he passed earlier in this phase, he could now decide to play an Intrigue card. But he checks his Intrigue cards, and none of them are Combat Intrigue cards. He passes again.***

***Abby, satisfied with her victory, also passes.***

***With 12 strength, Abby wins the Conflict. The top reward of the Conflict card, Secure Imperial Basin, gives her 2 spice, 1 troop (recruited from her supply to her garrison), and control of Imperial Basin. She places one of her Control markers on the flag below the Imperial Basin board space.***

***John wins the second-place reward, doubled because he had a sandworm in the Conflict (which was only possible after he destroyed the Shield Wall previously, on his Reveal turn). He takes 4 water and 2 troops (recruited from his supply to his garrison).***

***Ned receives nothing from this Conflict. He has 0 strength — and regardless, the third-place reward isn't available in a 3-player game.***

***As the winner, Abby also takes the Conflict card into her supply. If she had another face-up card with a Desert Mouse battle icon, she would flip them both face-down and gain 1 Victory Point. But she doesn't, so she will now be on the lookout to win another Conflict involving a Desert Mouse battle icon.***

***Finally, all troops are returned from the Conflict area to their owners' supplies. John's sandworm is returned to the bank.***

### PHASE 4: MAKERS (Page 15)

In this phase, spice can accumulate on Maker board spaces. Check each of the board spaces with a Maker icon: Deep Desert, Hagga Basin, and Imperial Basin. (In a six-player game, there is another: Habbanya Erg.) If the space does not have an Agent, place 1 spice from the bank on that space (in the spot designated for bonus spice). This spice is added to any bonus spice that may already be there from previous rounds.

***There is an Agent in Imperial Basin. (John played it there earlier this round.) There are no Agents in the Deep Desert or Hagga Basin, however, so each of those spaces gets 1 bonus spice. The Deep Desert already had 1 bonus spice from a previous round, so now it has 2 bonus spice.***

### PHASE 5: RECALL (Page 15)

If any player is at 10 or more Victory Points on the Score track, or if the Conﬂict Deck is empty, the Endgame is triggered.

If no one has won, prepare the next round:

- Players recall their Agents, returning them to their Leaders.

- Pass the First Player marker clockwise to the next player, then begin a new round with Phase 1.

***No one has reached 10 Victory Points, so all players' Agents are returned to their owners' supplies, and the First Player marker passes clockwise to Abby. A new round then begins, with Phase 1.***

#### ENDGAME (Page 15)

First, you may play and resolve any Endgame Intrigue cards you have. Then whoever has the most Victory Points is declared the winner.

If the case of a tie, tiebreakers are, in order: amount of spice, Solari, water, and garrisoned troops.

## CHOAM MODULE (Page 16)

DUNE: ***IMPERIUM — UPRISING*** comes with a mini-expansion called the CHOAM Module. We recommend that you play without it at least once to familiarize yourself with the game. When you feel comfortable, you can add the CHOAM Module for more strategic depth.

### SETUP (Page 16)

Add or modify the following steps of your setup:

A3. Shuffle the 20 contracts face down, then ﬂip two of them face up and place them on the marked spaces on the board beneath the Landsraad Council. Place the remaining 18 face down in the bank. 

C1. Shuffle the four additional Intrigue cards into your Intrigue Deck.

C2. Shuffle the four additional Imperium cards into your Imperium Deck.

D. A player has the option to choose Shaddam Corrino ***IV***
as their Leader. (Though this is not required.)

### TAKING CONTRACTS (Page 16)

When playing **without** the CHOAM Module, the contract icon means that you simply gain 2 Solari, as indicated on the board. But when playing **with** the CHOAM Module, this icon means that you take one of the two face-up contracts on the board and place it in your supply. When you take one, replace it with another contract from the bank, ﬂipped face up. (If all contracts have been taken by players, the icon reverts to giving you 2 Solari.)

> The icon is like a rectangular frame that has has a black circle bordered with an orange-colored ring.

### COMPLETING CONTRACTS (Page 16)

A contract represents your promise to fulﬁll a service for the CHOAM Corporation. Only when you have made good on that promise will you receive a "payment."

- Most contracts name a speciﬁc board space, and are completed by sending an Agent to that space.

- A **Harvest** contract is completed by sending an Agent to a Maker board space and gaining the amount of spice shown during that turn (in total, including from sources other than the space itself).

- The **Immediate** contract is completed as soon as you take it.

- The **Acquire** The Spice Must Flow contract is completed when you next acquire that card.

When you complete a contract, announce that you have done so, gain the rewards it shows, then ﬂip it face down. Leave it in your supply, as certain cards refer to "completed contracts."

If you take a contract involving the board space where you've already sent your Agent this turn, you must wait until a future turn to complete the contract. (That is, you must have had the contract at the time you sent your Agent.) 

### Playing The CHOAM Module With RISE OF IX (Page 16)

The RISE OF IX expansion replaces one of the locations on the UPRISING board where you can take a new contract. To compensate and jumpstart the completion of contracts, UPRISING includes 10 additional contracts (with different backs) to use speciﬁcally when playing with RISE OF IX.

After setting up the 20 standard contracts, shuffle the 10 RISE OF IX contracts and give two to each player. Each player looks at the two they've been given, choosing simultaneously which contract they want to begin the game with (placing it face up in their supply). Return all of the unchosen RISE OF IX contracts to the box.

## CLARIFICATIONS (Page 17)

**Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen** — During setup, place the Feyd token on the leftmost space of the Training track printed on the Leader. When the token reaches the rightmost space, it remains there for the rest of the game.

**Lady Jessica** — You begin the game with this side of the Leader (not Reverend Mother Jessica) face up.

**Lady Margot Fenring / Princess Irulan** — You "reach" 2 Inﬂuence even when you move past 2 while gaining multiple Inﬂuence at the same time. You can reach 2 Inﬂuence with the same Faction more than once per game by losing Inﬂuence and later regaining it — though you only reach 2 Inﬂuence when moving up the Inﬂuence track, not down.

**Shaddam Corrino IV** — When you play your Signet Ring to send an Agent to a board space, the Emperor of the Known Universe restriction on deploying units to the Conﬂict takes effect immediately.

**Spacing Guild's Favor** — Moving this card from in play to your discard pile during Clean Up does not trigger the discard ability. Only discarding it from your hand triggers the ability.

These clarifications pertain to UPRISING cards. The CHOAM Module on the opposite page is new.

## STRATEGY TIPS (Page 17)

Water is rare and precious on Dune, and essential to harvesting the valuable spice. The Spacing Guild can provide vital supplies, if you ﬁnd yourself in need. An alternative approach is to gain the favor of the Fremen and visit Sietch Tabr.

Spice is a versatile substance and there are many ways to use it. Three Factions provide valuable services in exchange for varying amounts of spice.

Solari is the currency of the Imperium and greases the workings of the Landsraad Council. Whether you're looking to make upgrades in the form of a Swordmaster or High Council seat, or just need some additional troops, don't come empty- handed.

Remember, when you're acquiring cards for your deck, part of what you're paying for is access to the various Factions. Take care not to leave yourself without the right tools to send Agents to key board spaces.

Gaining 2 Inﬂuence with a Faction not only provides a Victory Point, but also unlocks a unique ability related to that Faction. For the Emperor, ability related to that Faction. For the Emperor, Spacing Guild, and Fremen, a new board space Spacing Guild, and Fremen, a new board space will become available. For the Bene Gesserit, several cards become stronger. Try to unlock some several cards become stronger. Try to unlock some of these abilities quickly and use them to your advantage.

When it comes to winning Conﬂicts, position is everything. The longer you can wait to commit your units, the more information you'll have when you do so and the less opportunity your opponents will have to react.

Sometimes in a Conﬂict, a lesser victory achieved at a lower cost can be more valuable than a greater victory dearly bought.

Intrigue cards mean you can never be too certain which way a Conﬂict is going to break.

Gaining an Alliance with one of the Factions can be a powerful asset on your path to victory. Watch out for other players trying to race past you, and don't miss an opportunity to do the same to them!

Spies can provide a sense of security; their Inﬁltrate ability means you can't be blocked from sending an Agent to a space they are spying on. However, don't be shy about recalling them to Gather Intelligence — especially when you have multiple Spies in the ﬁeld.

The sandworms of Dune are powerful forces of nature. However, with the aid of the Fremen, it is possible to become a sandrider. This process requires some time, so if you go down this path, you may ﬁnd yourself behind other players in the middle of the game. Be sure to realize your investment by summoning sandworms whenever you have an opportunity to secure rewards from a Conﬂict. Even if you don't win a Conﬂict, doubling second or third place rewards can be important!

## COMBINING UPRISING WITH OTHER DUNE: IMPERIUM PRODUCTS (Page 18)

DUNE: _IMPERIUM — UPRISING_ is compatible with all previous _DUNE: IMPERIUM_ products.

### ADDING RISE OF IX (Page 18)

During setup, keep the CHOAM board overlay folded in half and cover only the top-right corner of the UPRISING board. This will create a new CHOAM section and cover the Assembly Hall and Gather Support board spaces in the Landsraad, while leaving the rest of the Landsraad board spaces in UPRISING unchanged.

Because RISE OF IX was produced before UPRISING, the CHOAM board overlay and Ix board don't have observation posts printed on them. **Play as if there is one observation post on each of those boards**: one observation post connects to Interstellar Shipping and Smuggling and the other connects to Tech Negotiation and Dreadnought.

We recommend that you do not add the Conﬂict cards from RISE OF IX. You may do so if you wish, but it will make matching battle icons slightly harder. (However, you will need one additional Conﬂict III card to play the Epic Game Mode. In this situation, you should add Economic Supremacy.)

Using Ilesa Ecaz requires the Foldspace cards from DUNE: IMPERIUM. (Allow Ilesa Ecaz to acquire Foldspace cards, even though they can't be acquired by anyone else.)

### ADDING IMMORTALITY (Page 18)

Although the Research Station in UPRISING is different from the one on the original DUNE: IMPERIUM game board, you should still cover it with the Research Station overlay.

### COMBINING WITH BASE DUNE: IMPERIUM (Page 18)

We recommend that you don't add the Conﬂict cards from DUNE: IMPERIUM. You may do so if you wish, but it will make matching battle icons harder.

As there is no Mentat in UPRISING, you should remove the Calculated Hire Intrigue card (and the Sort Through the Chaos Conﬂict card, if you've chosen to use the Conﬂict cards from DUNE: IMPERIUM).

You may shuffle all other Intrigue and Imperium cards with UPRISING if you wish, or create your own custom blend of select DUNE: IMPERIUM and UPRISING cards.

**Control.** If you win a Conﬂict with a Control reward (of Arrakeen, Spice Reﬁnery, or Imperial Basin), place your Control marker on the ﬂag below that space (replacing any opponent's marker there). When a Conﬂict card is revealed for a space that you already control, you may deploy one troop from your supply to the Conﬂict.
  > The icon looks like a grey bookmark icon with an arc inside.

**Discard** a card of your choice from your hand. (For this and any other time you're directed to discard a card, it cannot be an Intrigue card, unless speciﬁed.)

  > The icon consists of a shield-like shape as the background, with a long rod extending from the top of the shield. At the end of this rod, there's a hook-like structure.

**Paying a cost.** An arrow indicates a cost (left of the arrow, or above it) and an effect (right of the arrow, or below it). If you don't pay the cost, you don't get the effect. You do not have to pay such a cost on a card. You can't pay the cost more than once per turn (except when sandworm reward doubling applies to a reward on a Conﬂict card).
  > A series of three icons appear next to the description above: a white left arrow, a white down arrow, and a white downward-pointing triangle.

**Persuasion** (in the amount shown). You receive Persuasion mainly from the Reveal boxes on your cards. You use it to acquire Imperium or Reserve cards, paying the cost shown in the top right corner of a card.
  > The icon next to it has a white number one in a blue diamond-shape.

**Retreat.** — When you retreat a troop, move it from the Conﬂict back to your garrison.

**Sandworm.** Does nothing if the current Conﬂict is protected by the Shield Wall. Otherwise, summon and deploy one sandworm; take it from the bank and put it in your quadrant of the Conﬂict.
  > The icon looks like a grey sandworm, but it also looks like the number two. 

You may remove the **Shield Wall** token from the game board.
  > The icon appears as a golden broken shield on top of a red triangle.

**Signet Ring.** When you play your Signet Ring card on an Agent turn, you use the Signet Ring ability (with the corresponding icon) on your Leader.
  > The Signet Ring icon appears as a thick golden ring placed on the left side. The space inside the ring has a black background.

**Spy**. Place one Spy; take it from your supply and put it on an unoccupied observation post on the board. (Some effects limit placement. For example: a spy on a city means the observation post must connect to the city board space.) If you have no Spies in your supply, you may ﬁrst recall one of your Spies for no effect.
  > The icon appears as a grey barrel.

**Steal Intrigue.** Each opponent who has four or more Intrigue cards must give you one of them (selected at random).

  > The icon appears as a card with a white cross inside.

**Troop.** Recruit one troop; take it from your supply and put it in your garrison on the game board. (If you recruited the troop while sending an Agent to a Combat space, you may deploy it to the Conﬂict.)
  > The icon is like a grey cube.

**Trash one card** from your hand, discard pile, or in play. Return it to the game box; it won't be used for the rest of the game. (Reserve cards are returned to their stack in the Reserve instead.) Trashing is optional unless it's paying a cost, or if a card directs you to trash itself.
  > The icon appears as a card with a white cross inside.
